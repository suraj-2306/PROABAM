# PROABAM
`PROABAM` stands for `PRObabilistic Analysis Based Approximate Multiplier`. In this work three approximate booth multipliers with probabilistic analysis stage reduction is proposed. This repository is a reference for anyone who wishes to tweak or adapt the design flow for thier work.

Booth Multipliers for Error Resilient Applications,”2022 IEEE 19th India Council International Conference`

The implementation contains the following multipliers:
1. `Prop1App`: The first proposed multiplier
2. `Prop2App`: The second proposed multiplier
3. `Prop3App`: The third proposed multiplier
4. `ABM`: The implementation of [ABM mulitplier](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8753550)
5. `R4ABM1`: The implementation of [R4ABM1 mulitplier](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862783)
6. `R4ABM2`: The implementation of [R4ABM2 mulitplier](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862783)

## How to use
1. Start matlab in the main directory. The startup file initializes the paths to all the source files.
2. Call the appropriate multiplier by multiplier.

## Verilog Code Generation
Soon
